/**
 * Transcode on Finished (B8, D3) — the sweep.
 *
 * Marking a segment Finished is a real state transition: its PCM is transcoded
 * to MP3 and dropped, ~10x smaller (#12). Rather than chase every place the
 * transition can happen (the row menu, the recorder's checkbox on close, a take
 * saved with the mark, a retry of that save), the work is a SWEEP: find every
 * finished segment whose clip is still PCM (`listPcmFinishedSegments`), encode
 * each in the worker, and land it with `commitTranscode`. Any transition simply
 * asks for a sweep. The sweep is idempotent — a segment that no longer qualifies
 * by the time its commit runs is skipped there — so asking twice is harmless,
 * and so is dying half-way: the PCM is still there and the next launch's sweep
 * (App mounts one) picks the segment up again. That is what makes the drop safe
 * to do in the background at all.
 *
 * One sweep at a time, module-wide. A request during a run flags one more pass
 * after it, so a transition that lands while the worker is busy is not missed
 * and two sweeps never encode the same clip concurrently. Module state rather
 * than hook state on purpose: the callers are hooks on different screens, and
 * the guarantee has to hold across all of them (`audio-io.ts` holds its shared
 * `AudioContext` the same way).
 *
 * Memory: one segment's PCM at a time, and never alongside a share's — every
 * encode in the app goes through `withEncoder`'s single lane, and the sweep
 * takes the lane before it loads a clip. Peaks are computed before the encode
 * because the encode CONSUMES the buffer (transferred to the worker).
 *
 * A failed segment is logged and left as PCM — no state is lost, the list keeps
 * drawing it, and the next sweep retries. Nothing is shown to the translator:
 * from where they stand nothing has changed, and there is no action to offer.
