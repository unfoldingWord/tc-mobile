/**
 * The one navigation decision extracted from the browser-only History wiring so
 * it can be tested in Node: given where the app is, what a Back gesture means.
 *
 * The app is three screens layered as state in `App.tsx` — Books, Segments, and
 * the Recorder sheet over Segments (#168). Nothing was in the history stack, so
 * a standalone PWA's system Back gesture left the app entirely: on the recorder
 * that fired `pagehide` → `leave()` → the in-progress take was dropped with no
 * recovery slot (the #58 loss). Pushing one entry per screen turns that gesture
 * into a `popstate` the app routes here instead.
 *
 * The mapping that matters is `"recorder" → "commit-close-recorder"`: Back on the
 * recorder must run the commit path (`close()`), never the take-dropping
 * `leave()`. That is the line the test pins and a mutation must break.

 *   the take (#58).
 * - `to-books` returns from Segments to the Books shelf.

 *   leaves the app, which at the shelf loses nothing.
