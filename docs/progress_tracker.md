## 2026-08-22 — Day 1: scaffold to reviewed prototype

**Branch:** `develop` · **Commits:** 18 · **Repo created:** `sethstoll3/tc-mobile` (private)

### Completed

- **Scaffold** — Vite 7 + React 19 + TS strict + Tailwind 4, PWA via
  `vite-plugin-pwa`, onion architecture enforced by ESLint. Shape copied from
  `bt-servant-admin-portal` minus its BFF/auth/KV; Phase 1 has no backend
  (ADR 0005). `10cf265`
- **Audio core** — canonical mono 16-bit PCM @44.1kHz, sample-accurate
  cut/insert/paste/replace/concat, waveform peaks, WAV writer, MP3 via lamejs.
  Pure and DOM-free, so it is unit-testable in Node (ADR 0002, ADR 0003).
- **Storage** — IndexedDB as system of record (not a cache); clips, and the
  Project → Chapter → Section → Segment → Take tree. Schema at v2.
- **Open Bible Stories bundled** — 50 stories, 598 frames. Thumbnails
  downscaled to 128px are **2.5 MB, not the 46.8 MB the source implies**, so
  they ship with the app and the section list works offline on first run.
  `6173f8f`, `fc49026` (ADR 0006)
- **Design passes A and B** through `ux-then-ui`, all three gates approved.
  Artefacts published; records in `docs/design/`. `08f1b75`, `5520858`, `6a48748`
- **Working prototype** — section browser (grid for artwork chapters, list
  without), section view, three-layer CSS token system, pluggable timing seam.
  `2a78068`
- **Dual review pipeline** — Frank (codex, diff-local) + George (grok,
  deep-tree), both carrying the house evidence axioms. `fa3f4f5`, `5f7554b`
- **Deployment** — Cloudflare Workers Builds owns deploys; the four Actions
  deploy workflows were deleted to remove a real collision. `3464a30`, `3d9b931`
- **Both workers live** — `tc-mobile` and `tc-mobile-staging`.

### In progress

- **Review round 1 is complete and unfixed.** Frank and George both returned
  `REQUEST_CHANGES`: **4 P1 (#1–#4), 6 P2 (#5–#10), 1 P3 (#11)**. Deliberately
  left untouched so round 2 starts from a known base.
- Two **A+B convergences** — the playback race (#2) and the burrito
  chapter-drop (#6) — found independently by both lenses, which per prior
  experience makes them the highest-confidence findings of the round.

### Blockers / needs a human

- **#12** PCM storage strategy — must resolve before the October training.
- **#13** No OBS timing data exists anywhere; blocks record-along. Ask Tim and
  Benjamin Wright.
- **#14** lamejs LGPL-3.0 in an MIT repo.
- **#15** Are OBS-derived recordings CC BY-SA? Affects export and the data model.
- **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`** is deliberately _not_ a GitHub secret — Actions no
  longer deploys. The token lives in Cloudflare's build settings. Do not "fix".
- **Cloudflare repo linking** is a manual step in the dashboard: connect the
  repo to both Workers, `main`→`tc-mobile`, `staging`→`tc-mobile-staging`
  (`--env staging`), non-production builds on **one** only.

### Not covered by tests, honestly

MediaRecorder, `decodeAudioData`, and the share sheet are verified on-device
only. **Nothing has been tested on real hardware yet** — and iOS is the
platform most likely to break here.

### Next steps

1. Fix branch off `develop` addressing **#1–#10** in one pass; **#11** stays filed.
2. PR to `develop`, run both reviewers, loop to clean or capped-and-escalated.
3. First real device test — Android and iOS — on the staging URL.
